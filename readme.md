# Learning Style Recommender

This is a Streamlit-based machine learning app that recommends a user's preferred learning style based on a short questionnaire inspired by the VARK model (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic). You can learn a little more about VARK here: https://www.verywellmind.com/vark-learning-styles-2795156 

## Features

- 12-question interactive form
- Predicts learning style using a trained Decision Tree classifier
- Built with realistic synthetic data
- Deployed with Streamlit Cloud 

## Notes

This app uses a simple decision tree model trained on synthetic data.  
Typically, we would optimize this model using techniques like hyperparameter tuning (e.g., depth selection).

However, because this is a prototype built with synthetic, highly structured data and is designed for demonstration purposes only at this point, Iâ€™ve opted for a simpler model to prioritize clarity, speed, and usability.
